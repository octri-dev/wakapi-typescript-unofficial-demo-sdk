# Wakapi API TypeScript SDK

REST API to interact with [Wakapi](https://wakapi.dev)

## Authentication

Set header `Authorization` to your API Key encoded as Base64 and prefixed with `Basic`
**Example:** `Basic ODY2NDhkNzQtMTljNS00NTJiLWJhMDEtZmIzZWM3MGQ0YzJmCg==`

> Package `wakapi-unofficial-sdk` · Version `1.0.0` · 22 operations

## Installation

```sh
npm install wakapi-unofficial-sdk@1.0.0
```

## Quickstart

The example calls `getWakatimeLeaders` (GET `/compat/wakatime/v1/leaders`), a low-friction operation that requires no request arguments. Replace `https://api.example.com` with your server's URL.

```ts
import { Wakapi } from "wakapi-unofficial-sdk";

async function main() {
  const client = new Wakapi({
    baseUrl: "https://api.example.com",
    auth: { apiKeyAuth: process.env.API_TOKEN! },
  });
  const result = await client.wakatime.getLeaders();
  console.log(result);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Authentication

Keep credentials outside source control. The quickstart reads them from the environment and the client applies them to every request.

| Scheme     | ClientAuth field | Sent as                   |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| ApiKeyAuth | `apiKeyAuth`     | `Authorization` in header |

## Client behavior

- Base URL: set it in `ClientConfig` before the first request.
- Transport: Fetch API.
- Timeout: 30,000 ms per attempt.
- Retries: up to 3 attempts for status codes `408`, `425`, `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, `504`, with 500–8,000 ms backoff.
- Idempotency: enabled for `POST`, `PATCH` using `Idempotency-Key`.
- Error telemetry: off. This build has no reporting endpoint and sends no error reports.

High-level operation methods return the typed response body directly. The low-level request layer returns an `SdkResponse<T>` envelope containing data, status, headers, request ID, latency, and attempt count.

## Errors and response metadata

All failure paths use a small, predictable hierarchy:

| Error                | Meaning                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SdkValidationError` | A request argument failed an OpenAPI constraint before network I/O. |
| `SdkHttpError`       | The server returned a non-2xx response.                             |
| `SdkNetworkError`    | DNS, connection, TLS, or socket failure.                            |
| `SdkTimeoutError`    | The configured per-attempt timeout elapsed.                         |

HTTP errors expose `statusCode`, the response body and headers, plus `requestId` when the server supplies one. Preserve the request ID in support logs; it is the fastest way to correlate a failed SDK call with server-side traces.

Common statuses are reported as a subclass of `SdkHttpError`, so a handler can catch only the one it handles: `SdkBadRequestError` (400), `SdkUnauthorizedError` (401), `SdkPermissionDeniedError` (403), `SdkNotFoundError` (404), `SdkConflictError` (409), `SdkUnprocessableEntityError` (422), `SdkRateLimitError` (429), `SdkInternalServerError` (any 5xx). Any other status is reported as `SdkHttpError` itself.

When the API declares a model for an error response, `deserializeModel<ErrorModel>(error.body, "ErrorModel")` decodes the body into it, where `ErrorModel` is that model. The raw body stays available on the error.

An operation that declares error models also exports `<Operation>Error`, the union of those models, for typing a decoded body.

## Project layout and API discovery

- Operation implementations are grouped under `src/methods/`.
- 33 component models are split by API domain under `src/types/<domain>.ts` or `src/types/<tag path>/models.ts`, re-exported by `src/types/index.ts` and the package root.
- Component schemas can choose a nested model folder with `x-octri-sdk-tags: ["Billing/Invoices"]`; the first tag owns the model and `/` creates nesting.
- [`sdk-manifest.json`](sdk-manifest.json) is the language-neutral public API index: operations, request/response modes, model properties, enum values, and generation settings.
- Public barrel/module exports are the compatibility boundary. Import public model names from those exports; internal domain filenames may evolve without changing model names.

## Local mock-server tests

Generated SDK includes schema-derived, zero-dependency mock server and network
contract suite. Node.js 20+ required. Contract probes use authored response
examples only; schema-synthesized routes remain available to the local server.

`./scripts/mock --port 4010` starts server. `./scripts/test` runs the mock contract suite, then native SDK tests. A zero-authored-example contract run succeeds with an explicit zero-test
summary; mismatches in authored examples still fail.
